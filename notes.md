#NOTES

* Intro seemed to take to long.  Felt like about 60% of the class was checked out.  Might not be that important at the end of the day.
* Move intro to a series of quick bullet point slides.  For a book the golangbootcamp works fine, for a class it's too tedius.  Could be done more lightning talk style
* Have a list of major sites on whiteboard for :
  * tour.golang.org
